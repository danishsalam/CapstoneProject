##Predict student grade of a course after or during the first grade period. 

#The Problem:
Typically, on the school-wide level, benchmark testing couples student performance with extensive reporting systems in order to break down test results by the same student categories required under the federal No Child Left Behind Act (i.e. race, income, disability, and English proficiency) in addition to providing individual progress reports at the district, school, classroom, and student levels.

According to the California Department of Education, benchmark assessments often include performance tasks, but more frequently use “standardized administration and scoring procedures to help maintain validity, reliability, and fairness. Teachers usually administer common benchmark assessments to all students in the same course and grade level in the district at prescribed intervals — most often at the end of a unit of study or at the end of an academic year. 

However, It is highly possible that students who are identified as being mediocre after the benchmark assessment, could have been identified prior the assessment and expedite their progress after having some discussion.

This project will  help to identify the key early warning signs for students at risk of having lower grades and not reaching at the benchmark, and therefore taking action to expedite their progress to achieving their desired grades.
